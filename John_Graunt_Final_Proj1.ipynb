    "Typically, decreases in population growth could also be due to a decreasing share of adult women, perhaps due to gender selection at birth.  We can see from these two graphs that in the 1960s, North Korea had a comparatively higher share of women, though this sharply dropped in the 1970s. This could have been due to the effect of military losses increasing the relative % of women in the 60s. We also note the decrease in the mid-1990s, potentially because of the famine and only recovering in present-day statistics. South Korea gradually increased, and the % difference between female and male is not as pronounced and stayed relatively constant over the last few years.\n"

    "We also decided cereal yield would be an important factor to look at in terms of population, as it forms the bulk of staple foods for most populations. We can see that this is one clear area in which South Korea performs strongly and consistently in, whereas in North Korea, we can see that it reaches a peak of around 6000kg/ha right before a dramatic decrease in the mid 1990s. While South Korea continued to increase its cereal yield to almost 7000kg/ha, North Korea never recovered and its current yields are around 4500kg/ha. "

    "Above is a line graph that shows different agriculture factors in North Korea. Out of all of the lines, I think the most important ones to note are fertilizer, the red/orangish line, and machinery, the green line. As you can see in this graph, there was an increase in fertilizer over time until around 1977. At that point, fertilizer fluctuated a bit until 1993. From there, there was an extremely significant decline in fertilizer. This drop in fertilizer coincided with North Korea announcing a 3-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. A lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency. All of these factors led to North Korea’s famine, which was a period of mass starvation together with a general economic crisis that lasted from 1994 to 1998. If you look closely at the feed line, which is represented by the light blue line, you can see that it mimics the fertilizer trend as well. It’s not as extreme and apparent, but it definitely follows a similar pattern. Mechanization is another agricultural target that’s important and represented by the green line. You can see that there is a plateau in the green line starting from 1984. This is because by 1984, mechanization had reached the level of seven tractors per 100 hectares in the plains and six tractors per 100 hectares in the intermediate and mountainous areas. These ratios are quoted again in official pronouncements of the early 1990s, which indicates that there was no further advancement in mechanized agriculture since then. This aligns with our data, as we can see that the green line plateaus after 1984.\n"
